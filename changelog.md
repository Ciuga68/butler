# v2.1
1. Switched to using YAML config file.
2. Upgraded to latest versions of dependet libraries.
3. Removed disk space REST endpoint. This was done due to difficulties in isntalling the Windows version of the library used to get disk metrics. A full Windows development environment was needed - but as this is typically not desirable on a production Windows server, this REST endpoint was removed.
4.
