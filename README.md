# Butler for Qlik Sense

> Proxy app for carrying out features that Qlik Sense cannot do out of the box.

## Overview

Node.js based proxy app providing various add-on features to Qlik Sense, such as starting reload tasks or posting to Slack from the load script, keeping track of currently active users and much more.  

The app started out as a way of posting to [Slack](https://slack.com/) from [Qlik Sense](http://www.qlik.com/products/qlik-sense) (or [QlikView](http://www.qlik.com/products/qlikview)) load scripts, but has since been generalized and now offers a lot more features. 

Full documenation available [here](https://mountaindude.github.io/butler).
