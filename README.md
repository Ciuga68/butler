# Butler for Qlik Sense

> Proxy app for carrying out features that Qlik Sense cannot do out of the box.

## Overview

Node.js based proxy app providing various add-on features to Qlik Sense, such as starting reload tasks or posting to Slack from the load script, keeping track of currently active users and much more.  

The app started out as a way of posting to [Slack](https://slack.com/) from [Qlik Sense](http://www.qlik.com/products/qlik-sense) (or [QlikView](http://www.qlik.com/products/qlikview)) load scripts, but has since been generalized and now offers a lot more features. 

Full documenation available [here]().

* 
You should make sure to configure the firewall of the server where Buter is running, so it only accepts calls from the desired clients/IP addresses.
A reasonable first approach would be to configure the firewall to only allow calls from localhost.

* 
As of right now the MQTT connections are not secured by certificates or passwords.
For use within a controlled network that might be fine, but nonetheless something to keep in mind. Adding certificate based authentication (which MQTT supports) would solve this.
